    "The `udp` Python SDK is designed to streamline interactions with the Unstructured Data Processing (UDP) service on Cloud Pak for Data (CP4D). It provides a high-level interface to effortlessly create, manage, and execute data flows. At the heart of the SDK is the `UDPClient` class, which enables developers to define and run UDP flows with minimal code, making it easier to integrate unstructured data processing capabilities into Python-based workflows.\n",
